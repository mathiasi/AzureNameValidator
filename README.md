# AzureNameValidator

## Motivation
Since Azure .NET SDK v12, the NameValidator class is not available. This is still a useful helper-class so I have decided to republish that part of the library by itself so it can be used in conjunction with the newer libraries.

Original repo: https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net

# Changes
Changed namespace from `Microsoft.Azure.Storage` to `AzureNameValidator`
